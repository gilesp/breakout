# breakout
A half-hearted attempt at creating a clone of breakout.

## Or rather...
Starting from first principles, how do you create a javascript based game.

### Have a go

You can play a recent(-ish) version of the game [here](https://gilesp.github.io/breakout/index.html)

Space to launch, left * right arrow keys to move.

### TODO
1. Implement change of velocity when striking ball with bat
2. Implement lives
3. Implement game over
4. Other stuff I've forgotten.
